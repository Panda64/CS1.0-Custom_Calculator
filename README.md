# BMI_Custom_Calculator

This is a calculator that tells you what your BMI is (Body Mass Index) written in Python 3.7.9.

As explained in the the introductory message of the program, a BMI is a measure of ones body fat based on their height and weight. 

A normal BMI is anywhere from 18.5-24.9. Anything lower is considered underweight, and anything higher is considered overweight. 

This program is pretty self-explanatory, with clear instructions guiding the user through every step of the way.

When the program is opened, the user is prompted to enter how many feet tall they are. They are then asked to enter the remaining inches to their height. After confirming that the numbers they put in are correct, the program then ask for their weight. After yet another confirmation, the program will then output the users BMI, along with what classification they are in (underweight, normal, overweight, obese). The user will then have the option to either restart the program, or simply close it.

That is currently the extent of the my BMI calculator.
